# Pokemon-Team-Builder

This project was to test my knowledge from my previous [project](https://github.com/RJK3vin/Shopping-Cart) and experience more with APIs. 



- The App component manages the state of Pokemon data fetched from the PokeAPI and allows users to search for pokemon and browse through pages
- The ShowPokemon component displays Pokemon where users can click on them to manage their team 
- CSS is used to style the buttons and layout
